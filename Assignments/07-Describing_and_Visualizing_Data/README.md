# Week 07 - Describing and Visualizing Data

## 📖 Overview

This week we move beyond raw numbers and start making sense of data through **description** and **visualization**.  
You’ll learn how to classify different types of data, compute meaningful summary statistics, and create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

The week culminates in a **mini-lab**, where you’ll explore trends and outliers in a real dataset.  
By the end, you should feel comfortable turning numbers into insights (and plots that don’t look like they came from the 1980s).

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Distinguish between different **types of data** (qualitative vs quantitative, scales of measurement).
- Compute and interpret **summary statistics** (mean, median, variance, IQR, etc.).
- Build basic plots with **Matplotlib** (line, bar, scatter, histograms).
- Use **Seaborn** for more advanced, stylish visualizations.
- Identify **trends and outliers** in data using visual tools.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas** → data handling and summary statistics
- **Matplotlib** → foundational plotting library
- **Seaborn** → high-level visualization built on Matplotlib

Make sure you have Seaborn installed:

```bash
pip install seaborn
```
